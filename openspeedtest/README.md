## About

This uses the latest official unmodified [Docker image of OpenSpeedTest](https://hub.docker.com/r/openspeedtest/latest) as a Home Assistant Add-on.

Allows testing the network speed between any device in your local network and the device that runs Home Assistant. This is an alternative to running iperf3 server on the Home Assistant device and iperf3 client on another device in your local network. Advantage is that testing is done via your browser.
